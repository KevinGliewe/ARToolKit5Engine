# ARToolKit5 Android Archive Library (aar)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/KevinGliewe/ARToolKit5AAR.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/KevinGliewe/ARToolKit5AAR)

This project builds an aar file which can be imported into other Android-Projects. So you can use the ARToolKit without carrying the Library-Project around.
The main-repository is [here](https://github.com/artoolkit/artoolkit5).

The JPCT-AE classes are borrowed from [this project](https://github.com/plattysoft/ArToolKitJpctBaseLib).
