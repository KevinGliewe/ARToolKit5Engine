[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/KevinGliewe/ARToolKit5Engine.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/KevinGliewe/ARToolKit5Engine)

This Library adds an extra abstraction layer to build a AR-Application much more easily.

The ARToolKit5 repository is [here](https://github.com/artoolkit/artoolkit5).

The JPCT-AE classes are borrowed from [this project](https://github.com/plattysoft/ArToolKitJpctBaseLib).
